    <h3>Homework 1</h3>
    <div class="indent">
        <p class="question">
            For the three categories of web software technology we've just defined, you are asked to find out which
            category so-called "Chrome plug-in" technology belongs to. Please describe the basic idea of the technology,
            and give your reasoning on its position in the technology categories.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think "Chrome plug-in" technology belongs to <b>Distributed Object Technology</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Chrome plug-in" is a kind of plugin that runs within a web page and adds functionality to it by invoking
            PPAPI (or NPAPI on older Chrome versions). For example, Adobe Flash Player in Chrome is a PPAPI plugin that
            helps view multimedia contents and execute Internet applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Chrome plug-in" follows the principle of "distributed object". It is distributed on browser side and gives
            users remote access to objects or functions on a different server. Further more, PPAPI allows it to "plug
            and play" anywhere. These makes it interoperable regardless of time, space, platform and awareness, and
            that's why it belongs to Distributed Object Technology.

    <h3>Homework 2</h3>
    <div class="indent">
        <p class="question">
            In a normal intercommunication between Web browser and Web Server, Web Server closes the network
            communication right after it sends back the document requested by the browser. Think about this
            <b>statusless</b> character of World Wide Web. Give some good points and bad points of it. Can a web server
            know exactly how many browsers are reading its document?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Good points</b> of the <b>statusless</b> character of World Wide Web:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Without having to wait ages for client to respond, web server can be more efficient, which means it can
                response quicker and handle more requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                Statusless makes logic simpler for both server end and client end, and therefore reduces cpu and memory
                consumption.
            </li>
            <li>
                This also relieves pressure on the network line of both sides.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>Bad points</b>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Statusless character is not conductive to complex communication between server and client.
            </li>
            <li>
                The server doesn't know if the client have received the whole document, and the repeated transmission of
                a full document can be a great waste.
            </li>
            <li>
                The cost of reconnecting is relatively high when a client requests many documents from the same website.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A web server <b>CANNOT</b> know exactly how many browsers are reading its document in a normal
            intercommunication case, because the server closes communication right after it sends out the document, and
            browsers won't inform the server when closing the document.
        </p>

    <h3>Homework 3 (optional)</h3>
    <div class="indent">
        <p class="question">
            Open Question: of those client side technologies, why Java Applet is getting dead and Javascript success?
            Try to explain from the "REST" perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            To run Java applet you'll need to install JRE, which is inconvenient. Portability is also limited since some
            mobile platforms don't support applet runs. JavaScript, on the contrary, is web native and plays nice with
            HTML and CSS. It is widely supported by most modern explorers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Java applet runs within JVM in a process separate from the web browser itself, so its capability to interact
            with browser is not as good as JavaScript. Since it is self-contained, it doesn't have access to client-side
            resources like files and operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many other reasons. For example, Java applet is much unsafer, since malicious developers may
            implant backdoors to track users or perform harmful actions. Besides, applets must be compiled into machine
            code before testing or deploying, while you can simply run JavaScript codes. There is also saying that
            JavaScript is easier to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a word, Java applet violets some constraints of the REST architecture style but JavaScript doesn't. That
            is why Java Applet is getting dead and Javascript success.
