            <p class="question">Develop an XML file to represent a book of recipes. The data in this example (<a href="http://162.105.146.180/wst/webtech2019/unit7UWE/cook.xml">cook.xml</a>) is very poorly designed but you may wish to use it as starting point.</p>

            <p class="question">Write a short article if you wish to draw the markers attention to something you are pleased with!</p>
            <p>My recipe collection is quite rich in content. In addition to ingredients and instructions, it also includes cooking difficulty, cooking time, a brief description of the food, and the source of the recipe.</p>
            <p>It is also worth mentioning that above contents have been carefully organized to make it easier to read.</p>
